Preprocessing individual brain wave for pairing with certain software/device.

Ideas: Each individual have different brain wave ranges, in order to optimize the usage of certain devices or applications, the preprocessing becomes essential.

How it work:

1. putting your neurosky device, and run our program.
2. you will see a white circle changing in size
3. then the program will record your brain wave roughly each second
4. future developing --> collective data can be use to optimize certain brain computer interface device.
