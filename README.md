Preprocessing individual brain wave for pairing with certain software/device.

Ideas: Each individual have different brain wave ranges, in order to optimize the usage of certain devices or applications, the preprocessing becomes essential.

How it work:

1. putting your neurosky device, and run our program.
2. you will see a white circlein changes in size
3. the program will record your brain wave roughly each second
4. the attention and mediation wave (two indicators) data can be analyze correspond to certain size of the white circle
5. future developing --> collective data can be use to optimize certain brain computer interface device.
